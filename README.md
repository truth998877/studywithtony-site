## Study Along with [Me](http://www.tonyruther.com)

Study along with me as I live stream my journey from A-level physics and chemistry through to undergrate level and beyond.

## Live Stream

If I'm live say Hi in the chat, else follow me on Twitch to be notified when I'm next of online...

## Why Study Physics in 2020?

23 years ago I graduated with a degree in Physics, having also completed 2 years of undergraduate level chemistry. For 17 years out of those 23 I have worked in aerospace engineering, in a role which I have enjoyed immensely, however, it  has meant that I have not used much of the knowlegde I learnt for my degree. If fact I have used very little of it and as a result I no longer pocess this knowledge. Looking back at the time just before I obtained by degree results, if someone had said to me that by the age of 45 this would be the case, I would have proably laughed at them, so strong was my desire further my studies and become a professional physicist. Little did I know, that my degree results weren't great.

My desire now is to renew my knowledge and to catch up on the amazing advancements which has occured in both fields in the time since I graduated, the discovery of the Higgs boson, dection of graviational waves, quantum computing supremacy and imaging of an black hole event horizon to name a few.  And when I'm done, if that can ever be said within such a fueld, perhaps to put this knowledge to use professionally, if the right opportunity arises.

## [Syllabus](/syllabus)

To aid my studies I am developing a syllabus which will take me from A-level right through to undergraduate level. For Physics it will be based on three text books:

  * Physics (Bath Science 16-19), Robert Hutchings,  ISBN: 9780174385103
  * University Physics with Modern Physics, Freedman & Young, 11e, ISBN: 9780321204691
  * An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics, Carrol & Ostlie, ISBN: 9781108422161 (also known as the big orange book, bob)

My chemistry syllabus will be based on the following textbook:

  * A-Level Chemistry, E.N Ramsden, 3rd Edition, ISBN: 9780748716883 

I still possess all of my undergraduate textbooks, and some others I've aquired over the last couple of years. 

Furthermore, I will also be learning linux, particularly, bash (shell scripting), vi/vim (text editor), tmux (terminal multiplexer) and lynx (textbased web browser) as I'm finding that the command line is a very efficient interface and I wish to improve in this area.

## Work Flow

My plan is to live stream to this site (via [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/studywithtony)) while studying, taking handwritten notes from the books as I read through them (onenote on ipad pro, so no trees will be harmed during my re-eduation), attempting all exercises. Once I complete a section or chapter, I will create 'typed up' summary notes, this will be found on this site's sister sites, [www.myphysicsnotes.com](http://www.myphysicsnotes.com) and [www.mychemistrynotes.com](https://www.mychemistrynotes.com). For each live stream I will publish what will be studied in advance.

## Schedule

Live from 9:30pm Mon-Thurs, until I need sleep. (Friday and Saturday nights are [games nights](http:///www.fortiesgamer.com)) and from 7-10am Sat-Sun.
