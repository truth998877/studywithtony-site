  <p>Study along with me as I live stream my journey from A-level physics and chemistry through to undergrate level and beyond.</p>

  <p>If I’m live say Hi in the chat, else follow me on Twitch to be notified when I’m next of online…</p>

  <h2 id="why-study-physics-or-chemistry-in-2020">Why Study Physics or Chemistry in 2020?</h2>
  <p>In 1997, I graduated with a degree in Physics, having also completed 2 years of undergraduate level Chemistry. Since then, I have worked for 17 years in aerospace engineering, in a role which I have enjoyed immensely, however, it has meant that I have not used much of the knowlegde I learnt for my degree. There are not many opportunities to use Quantum Theory in Gas Turbine Performance Engineering. If fact I have used very little of what I learnt for my degree, and as a result I simply no longer possess the knowledge. Looking back at the time just before I obtained by degree results, if someone had said to me that by the age of 45 this would be the case, I would have proably laughed at them, so strong was my desire further my studies and become a professional physicist. Little did I know then, that my degree results weren’t the greatest and my hope of become a professional physicist indefiniately put on hold.</p>
  <p>My desire now is to renew my knowledge and to catch up on the amazing advancements which has occured in both fields in the time since I graduated, the discovery of the Higgs boson, dection of graviational waves, quantum computing supremacy and imaging of an black hole event horizon to name a few. And when I’m done, if that can ever be said within such a fueld, perhaps to put this knowledge to use professionally, if the right opportunity arises.</p>
  <h2 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h2>
  <p>To aid my studies I am developing a syllabus which will take me from A-level right through to undergraduate level. For <a href="/ALevelsyllabus">Physics</a> it will be based on three text books:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Physics (Bath Science 16-19), Robert Hutchings, ISBN: 9780174385103</li>
  <li>University Physics with Modern Physics, Freedman &amp; Young, 11e, ISBN: 9780321204691</li>
  <li>An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics, Carrol &amp; Ostlie, ISBN: 9781108422161 (also known as the Big Orange Book, BOB!)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My <a href="/ALevelsyllabus">Chemistry</a> syllabus will be based on the following textbook:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A-Level Chemistry, E.N Ramsden, 3rd Edition, ISBN: 9780748716883</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I still possess all of my undergraduate textbooks, and some others I’ve aquired over the last couple of years. I also still possess all of the university lecture notes. From these, and the undergraduate books above, I will develop the undergraduate syllabus that I will follow over the coming weeks and months.</p>
  <h2 id="preparation-work---linux-command-line-proficiency">Preparation work - Linux Command Line Proficiency</h2>
  <p>I will also be learning to proficiently use the linux command line, particularly, bash (shell scripting), vi/vim (text editor), tmux (terminal multiplexer), lynx (textbased web browser), markdown and pandoc. I’m finding that the command line is a very efficient interface and I’m beginning to find graphical interfaces annoying - when I have many ‘windows’ open I simply get lost. So I wish to improve my proficiency in using the linux command line, however, in that regard, I have already started. This very site was put together by using nothing but command line tools. All content has been generated using markdown created in Vim, and Pandoc was used within a bash script to render the markdown files into html.</p>
  <h2 id="work-flow">Work Flow</h2>
  <p>My plan is to live stream to this site (via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/studywithtony">twitch</a>) while studying. Handwritten notes will be taken as I work through the textbooks (onenote on ipad pro, so no trees will be harmed during my re-eduation). All exercises will be attempted. Once I complete a section or chapter, I will create ‘typed up’ summary notes in markdown. These will then be found on this site’s sister sites, <a href="http://www.myphysicsnotes.com">www.myphysicsnotes.com</a> and <a href="https://www.mychemistrynotes.com">www.mychemistrynotes.com</a>.</p>
  <p>However, the above won’t be all I do. It has been shown that the best study strategies require elements of self testing and what is called distributed practice. Its not clear to me what method of self testing would be best suited to me, however, whatever method I’ll use, it must be done. I must determine whether or not I know what I’ve studied! Distrubuted practice means re-visiting a topic several times over a long period. This means that I will not simply move through my syllabus and be done. Each area will be covered more than once, and I will be producing more material than that which will appear on my notes sites above.</p>
  <p>For each live stream, I will publish what will be studied in advance.</p>
  <h2 id="timescale">Timescale</h2>
  <p>In the UK an A-Level is most often studied over two years, and an undegraduate course (BSc) lasts three. However, I will not put a timescale on my self right now. I will just study, and keep studying until I’m comfortable with all the material.</p>
  <h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
  <p>Live from 9:30pm Mon-Thurs, until I need sleep, (Friday and Saturday nights are <a href="https://www.fortiesgamer.com/live">games nights</a>) and from 7-10am Sat-Sun. I will probably stream at other times too. If I’m studying, I’ll be streaming…</p>
  <h2 id="previous-live-streams"><a href="/previouslivestreams">Previous Live Streams</a></h2>
  <p>Catch up with my previous steams over on my previous live streams page. These will be host on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPH_kDcoQMA5zav2OwgFng">youtube</a>.</p>
