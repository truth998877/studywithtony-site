  <h2 id="why-study-physics-in-2020">Why Study Physics in 2020?</h2>
  <p>23 years ago I graduated with a degree in Physics. For 17 years out of those 23 I have worked in aerospace engineering, in a role which I have enjoyed immensely, however, it has meant that I have not used much of the knowlegde I learnt for my degree. If fact I have used very little of it and as a result I no longer pocess this knowledge. Looking back at the time just before I obtained by degree results, if someone had said to me that by the age of 45 this would be the case, I would have proably laughed at them, so strong was my desire further my studies and become a professional physicist. Little did I know, that my degree results weren’t great.</p>
  <p>My desire now is to renew my knowledge and to catch up on the amazing advancements which has occured in the field in the time since I graduated, the discovery of the higgs boson, dection of graviational waves, quantum computing supremacy and imaging of an black hole event horizon to name a few. And when I’m done, if that can ever be said within such a fueld, perhaps to put this knowledge to use professionally, if the right opportunity arises.</p>
  <h2 id="syllabus"><a href="/syllabus">Syllabus</a></h2>
  <p>To aid my studies I am developing a syllabus which will take me from A-level right through to undergraduate level. Primarily it will be based on three text books:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Physics (Bath Science 16-19), Robert Hutchings, ISBN: 9780174385103</li>
  <li>University Physics with Modern Physics, Freedman &amp; Young, 11e, ISBN: 9780321204691</li>
  <li>An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics, Carrol &amp; Ostlie, ISBN: 9781108422161 (also known as the big orange book, bob)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However I still poccess all of my undergraduate textbooks and some others I’ve aquired over the last couple of years.</p>
  <h2 id="work-flow">Work Flow</h2>
  <p>My plan is to live stream to this site (via twitch) while studying, taking handwritten notes from the books as I read through them (onenote on ipad pro, so no trees will be harmed during my re-eduation), attempting all exercises. Once I complete a section or chapter, I will create ‘typed up’ summary notes, this will be found on this site’s sister site, <a href="http://www.myphysicsnotes.com">www.myphysicsnotes.com</a>. For each live stream I will publish what will be studied in advance.</p>
  <h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
  <p>Live from 9:30pm Mon-Fri, until I need sleep, and from 7-10am Sat-Sun</p>
